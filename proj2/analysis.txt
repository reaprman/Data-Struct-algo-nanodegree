NOTE:
All answers are the Time Complexity analysis of only the code added to answer each task
for set(s) and dict(s) I am using the average case on (if in) look ups as python hash function can make collisions uncommon

problem1.py
used a dict for the map to hold the nodes of the cache and used the key of the each node to link in the map
as there are no loops and 20 lines of code for the get function. storing the nodes in the map allows for constant
time look up.

set function contains 14 lines of code and no loops.

time complexity for get function - O(1)
time complexity for set function - O(1)

f(n) = O(1)


Problem2.py
This problem has 7 lines of code with 1 loop and 1 recursive call. the recursive call is only depeding on how many subfolders
the original folder path contains. The recursion here is difficult to calculate and the course doesn't really provide any details on this so
my best guess is below.the f(n) represents the recursive function. n in this case represents the number of sub folders

f(n) = 4n+1 + f(n)


Problem3.py
I did not use a heap on this as it was more difficult to handle. used a list that needed to be sorted.
print function - O(n) n is the number of nodes
huffman leafnodes function - 8 lines of code with 2 recursive calls each time the function is called
O(2^n)
huffman encoding function - 3 loops non nested with recursive function call and sorting
f(n) = n + n + 10n * log n = O(n log n)

get encoded text function - 4 lines of code and 1 loop - n+2
function to return decoded data - 12 lines of code with 1 loop  - 6n + 4

worst case time complexity
f(n) = O(2^n)

Problem4.py
only 1 funciton to code here.
9 lines of code with 1 loop and 1 recursive call, 1 if in statement (loop)
n is the number of groups to search through
f(n) is the time complexity for the recursive function. as it is called recursively this plays apart into the calculation
I was unable to identify a method to break it down further.

f(n)= n+4 + n(f(n)) + 1  = 2n(f(n)) + 5

Problem5.py
createtimestamp function - O(1)
hash function - O(1)
add block function - 10 lines of code no loops or recursion = O(1)
append function - 9 lines of code no loops or recursion = O(1)

f(n) = O(1)


Problem6.py
2 functions added. intersection function has if in check (loop)

union -  2n+2n+n + 4  = 5n+4 = O(n)
intersection - 2n+2n + n^2 + 6 = 4n + n^2 +6 = O(n^2)

f(n) = O(n^2)
